The 2018-2022 Information Systems Master Plan of the Integrated Public Use Healthcare System of Catalonia (SISCAT) establishes the commitment of building a new health information system shared by all health providers that contributes to the transformation of the health service provision model in Catalonia.<br>

Cataloniaâ€™s new EHR is the backbone of a new information systems model that is just starting to emerge during the so-called second phase of the digital transformation for the Catalan health sector. In Catalonia in 2007 a significant process of change began as a result of major successful projects such as the interconnection of EHRs across the public network of providers, e-prescription, the central system of digital medical imaging or the personal digital health platform, placing us among the leading countries in the adoption of digital health solutions.

This repository contains Catalan clinical models based on openEHR standard.
It contains archetypes, templates and termsets, and will include both published assets and unpublished/unstable assets undergoing active development and review.
